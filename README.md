# Design of Area Effcient Low Latency 5G Compliant LDPC Decoder Architecture
## It is my MTech Thesis Dissertation Topic. Lets discuss about its implementation.
<p align="justify"> Your Text **Abstract** — This paper proposes a low-complexity check nodeunit architecture for 5G new radio (5G-NR) compliant lowdensity parity-check (LDPC) decoder. The complexity of the check node unit architecture is reduced by computing the frst minimum value in the conventional way and second minimum value by adding a small value alpha (α) to frst minimum value. The bit error rate (BER) versus signal to noise ratio (SNR) performance analysis graph shows that this second minimum approximation (SMA) decoding method gives a reasonable error while comparing it with conventional min-sum and offset minsum decoding methods. A novel architecture is presented and synthesized on Xilinx Artix-VII FPGA board. The synthesis results show that proposed design provides 45.5% reduction in number of LUTs along with 24.8% reduction in data path delay than state-of-the-art architectures. Thus, the proposed check node unit architecture with second minimum approximation decoding algorithm outperforms all the other existing architectures.
